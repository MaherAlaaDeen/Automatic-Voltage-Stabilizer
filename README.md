# Automatic-Voltage-Stabilizer
## Abstract
This project provides an overview of DC power supplies and relay-based voltage stabilizers, two important electrical devices used to regulate and supply power to electronic devices. The report explains how a DC power supply converts AC voltage to a stable DC voltage, and how a relay-based voltage stabilizer regulates the incoming voltage level using an autotransformer and an electromechanical relay. The report also discusses the various features and benefits of these devices and their applications in different industries. Overall, this report highlights the importance of these devices in ensuring the safe and reliable operation of electronic devices.

## Objectives
1.	To explain about the voltage stabilizer.
2.	To design and simulate an automatic voltage stabilizer.
3.	To implement and test the designed stabilizer.

## Background Theory
- A Voltage Stabilizer is an electrical device which is used to provide a constant voltage output to a load at its output terminals irrespective of any change/ fluctuation in the input i.e. incoming supply.
- The basic purpose of a Voltage Stabilizer is to protect the electrical/ electronic gadgets (for example â€“ Air conditioning Unit, Refrigerator, TV, etc.) from the probable damage due to Voltage Surge/ fluctuations, Over Voltage and Under Voltage conditions.
